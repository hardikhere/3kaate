Two player game we used to play in our school while teacher was teaching boring history lessons.
You have to align all 3 of your tokens in a line.<br/>

<br/>So When someone aligns token in a line then he wins. In each chance one will get a chance to shift its any of the token to the consicutive point (just left right up down) if position is unoccupied.
You can't go like this.</br>

You can just go one step left right up down.</br>
